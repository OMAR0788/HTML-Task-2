    <h1>Who we are?</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to "Flavors of Palestine," where the rich tapestry of Palestinian
      cuisine comes to life. Nestled in the heart of the city, our restaurant is
      a homage to the vibrant flavors and cultural heritage of Palestine. From
      the aromatic spices of our traditional kebabs to the heartwarming comfort
      of our maqluba, each dish is a journey through the diverse landscapes of
      Palestinian gastronomy. Our chefs, inspired by family recipes passed down
      through generations, craft each meal with love and authenticity. The warm
      and welcoming ambiance invites you to savor not just the food but also the
      essence of Palestinian hospitality. Whether you're relishing the crispy
      perfection of falafel or delighting in the sweetness of knafeh, "Flavors
      of Palestine" is more than a restaurant; it's a culinary expedition
      through the soul of a resilient and flavorful culture.
